Andrew Perrie - Family is a strong and identifiable part of my life. I have loving wife and a son who I absolutely adore. I have a creative side and an competitive side, in my spare time I love to take pictures and videos and if I'm not at my desk, you can find me at the arena playing hockey or hiking at our family winery.

I studied sports and business development which lead me to an amazing career in the fitness industry. Helping thousands of clients reach their fitness goals and creating positive relationships that lasted my entire term with my previous company.  

When it comes to buying or selling your home I focus on your specific needs. Whether it's buying a starter home, your dream home, that special vacation home, or selling your home, I make sure that everything is always done with your best interest in mind. When I asked people what makes great Realtor, I usually hear 1 of 2 responses.

1.) Honesty, people want to have confidence in their realtor and be told the truth. They want to make sure the Realtor has their best interests at heart.

2.) Communication, people want someone who will be in consistent contact. Wether it's good news or bad, they want and NEED to be informed every step of the way. These two principles are my core values when working together.","43.220580730000002","-79.122976800000004",,,./0.png
